# MultiUserChat
We aim to create a multi-user chat based on the client-server model that sends and receives messages. Each user will be able to chat to multiple other users simultaneously (many-to-many) and share details and information amongst themselves. We plan to do this in Java using socket programming and telnet as our connection protocol and plan to encrypt the sensitive information using RSA cryptographic algorithm. Over an intranet, corporations can establish a telnet server and use it as a means to communicate within their office building. This idea of an encrypted centralized chat server can serve as a startup step for many up and coming companies and also has a crucial role in business as communication between employees is essential.
